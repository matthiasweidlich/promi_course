        "The log originates from a Dutch Financial Institute. It contains some 262.200 events in 13.087 cases. Apart from some anonymization, the log contains all data as it came from the financial institute. The process represented in the event log is an application process for a personal loan or overdraft within a global financing organization. The amount requested by the customer is indicated in the case attribute AMOUNT_REQ, which is global, i.e. every case contains this attribute. The event log is a merger of three intertwined sub processes. The first letter of each task name identifies from which sub process (source) it originated from.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the process, an application is submitted through a webpage. Then, some automatic checks are performed, after which the application is complemented with additional information. This information is obtained trough contacting the customer by phone. If an applicant is eligible, an offer is sent to the client by mail. After this offer is received back, it is assessed. When it is incomplete, missing information is added by again contacting the customer. Then a final assessment is done, after which the application is approved and activated.\n",
